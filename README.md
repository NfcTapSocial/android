# Tap Social

ðŸ”— Introduce a brand new social connection way - NFC Tap Social ðŸŽ‰

## ðŸ’¡ Project Introduction

By using the [HEC (Host-based card emulation)](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/nfc/hce) ability of Android NFC (Near-Field Communication), 

We are trying to make our Android phone become a NFC sender which can send our social website link to everyone, with Just One Tap âœ…

We believe that NFC technology can truly change the way to make social connection, easier and more fun ðŸ¥³ 

> But we couldn't make it till the Hackerthon ended, because something went wrong in the reaction between two Android Phones. 
> 
> That is, the `HostApduService` instructed by Android Doc couldn't be invoked. And we tried our best debugging it but failed. 
> 
> Since we started to learn Android from scratch, I think we could have the change to solve in the near future!
